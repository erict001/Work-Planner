# Work-Planner

## Description
This work planner uses html and jQuery to help us build a workable work planner that allows us to input text, save the text upon refresh, and tracks the hours in your day. 

I struggled with getting the moment.js to properly display in the text area and instead shows up in the hour section. If I were to do this again, I would hope to figure out that element. I'm also curious how to have the data refresh when the next day begins at 12am.

## Installation
1. Clone Repository
2. Open the main page url on your browser
3. To run the project, just input your plan for text into the hour that you plan to operate your task. 

## Usage
To use this application, you need to input whatever action item you want into the input field assosciated with the hour block. The running clock at the top displays the current time so you can stay on schedule.

The work planner saves your input data and displays upon refresh.
